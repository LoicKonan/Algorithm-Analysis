*    Label:            Recursion Blobs
*    Title:            Program 1
*    Course:           CMPS 5243,  Spring 2022, Dr. Johnson
*    Semester:         Spring 2022
*    Description:
*
*                  This program use recursion to count the number
*                  of blobs in a 2D array. A text file containing
*                  a 2D matrix of 0's and *'s is given.
*                  A blob is connected group of *'s.
*                  The *'s are connected if they are von Neumann neighbors
*                  (top, bottom, left or right)
*                  This program uses 4 fuctions:
*
*                  1 - Main: which is the driver program.
*                  2 - open_File: will prompt the user for information.
*                  3 - print_world: will print the original and mutated array.
*                  4 - recursion_blobs: will recursively replace all *
*                      of the *'s in the blob with #'s
*                  5 - header: will Display the heading and explanation of
*                      the program to the output file.
*
*    Files:
*         main.cpp
*         outfile
*         infile
*
*    Usage:
*           main.cpp          : driver program
