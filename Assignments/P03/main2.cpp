    Assignment: Balanced vs Non-Balanced Trees Experiment

        Working alone or in a group no larger than 3 students, compare the efficiency of a regular, non-balanced
        binary search tree to a balanced binary search tree (AVL, RB, or some other balanced tree).

        - Datasets: Insert each number generated into two trees â€“ a regular BST & a Balanced BST. The size of 
          the dataset, n, is your choice. Suggestion: Start with a small size (Ex. n = 10) and increase once you
          are confident your code is producing accurate results. Bigger datasets will likely produce a greater
          disparity between the two trees. Dataset variations should include:

                - Insert random values within a specified range of your choice with no restrictions on the order of the 
                  data is inserted.

                - Insert a root value that is the median of a specified range and then follow with random numbers
                  within that range. Ex. Insert 5,000 as the root value if numbers range from 1-10,000.

                - Insert a root value that is closer to one of a specified range and then follow with random numbers 
                  within that range. Ex. Insert 2,500 as the root value if numbers range from 1-10,000.

        - After the trees are created with identical datasets, implement code that will:

                - Compare the height of the unbalanced trees to the balanced trees.

                - Compare the number of steps for insertion of random numbers. Use a counter and document 
                  where you increment the counter. This should be addressed in your report.

                - Compare the number of steps required for searching random numbers. Use a counter for this as with 
                  the previous program.

        - After you have compared the two types of trees with each of the three datasets, loop for multiple runs 
          so that results can be averaged. Remember to document the number of runs in your report.

        - If time allows and you are feeling industrious, include an outer loop that will vary the dataset size, 
          n. This is not required but might produce interesting results.
